<h1>Bangalore</h1>
<hr>
<p>Bangalore is known as the "Garden City of India" because of its greenery,[222] broad streets, and presence of many public parks, such as Lal Bagh and Cubbon Park.[223] In May 2012, guidebook publisher Lonely Planet ranked Bangalore third among the world's top ten cities to visit.[224]

    Biannual flower shows are held at the Lal Bagh Botanical Gardens during the weeks of India's Republic Day and Independence Day.[225] Bangalore Karaga or "Karaga Shaktyotsava" is one of Bangalore's oldest festivals and is dedicated to the Hindu goddess Draupadi. It is celebrated annually by the Thigala community over a period of nine days in March or April. The Someshwara Car festival, held annually in April, is a procession of the idol of the Halasuru Someshwara Temple (Ulsoor) led by the Vokkaligas, a major landholding community in southern Karnataka. Karnataka Rajyotsava is widely celebrated on 1 November and is a public holiday in the city, to mark the formation of Karnataka state on 1 November 1956. Other popular festivals in Bangalore are Ugadi, Ram Navami, Eid ul-Fitr, Ganesh Chaturthi, St. Mary's feast, Dasara, Deepawali and Christmas.[226][227]
    
    Bangalore's social and economic diversity is reflected in its cuisine.[228] Roadside vendors, tea stalls, and South Indian, North Indian, Chinese and Western fast food are all popular.[229] Udupi restaurants are popular and serve predominantly vegetarian, regional cuisine.[230] Bangalore is also home to many vegan restaurants and vegan activism groups, and has been named as India's most vegan-friendly city by PETA's Indian branch
